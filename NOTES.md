## Simple component "libary"

- Create a component with props template, state, and style
- Template is a function that takes a state as it’s only prop, and returns a ‘HTML’ string 
- State is an object with props. The component should ‘render’ when any prop changes. 
- Style will be a css string it just gets applied 
- Each component should have instances 
- Web component wrapper
